the proposal this software is solve a problem of the original test software:

this will used for NEBULA station (its a FCT eletric test)

this softaware not start the test of the automatic way, so we have to develop other software to do this, the software make a 
serial communication to get a sensor down to known when must start a test.

Materail used:

1. Arduino
2. C# software to get a sensor signal from CLP
3. TinyTask, program to move mouse and click on the test button

How to configurate it:

first: Install the AutoTestGM program.
second: Make a upload to arduino board, see the route wired pins.
third: create a folder in the C:\ root (ex.: C:\teste) with the record program (click on test button) and put it.
c:\teste\teste.exe, use the TinyTask to do it.
